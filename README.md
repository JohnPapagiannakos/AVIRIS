# AVIRIS

"AVIRIS is a proven instrument in the realm of Earth Remote Sensing. It is a unique optical sensor that delivers 
 calibrated images of the upwelling spectral radiance in 224 contiguous spectral channels (bands) with wavelengths 
 from 400 to 2500 nanometers. AVIRIS has been flown on four aircraft platforms: NASA's ER-2 jet, 
 Twin Otter International's turboprop, Scaled Composites' Proteus, and NASA's WB-57. The ER-2 flies at 
 approximately 20 km above sea level, at about 730 km/hr. The Twin Otter aircraft flies at 4km above ground 
 level at 130km/hr. AVIRIS has flown North America, Europe, portions of South America, and Argentina.

 The main objective of the AVIRIS project is to identify, measure, and monitor constituents of the Earth's surface 
 and atmosphere based on molecular absorption and particle scattering signatures. Research with AVIRIS data is 
 predominantly focused on understanding processes related to the global environment and climate change."

This project aims to generate a third order tensor from AVIRIS (https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/) dataset, using MATLAB.
